# Road-Traffic-Accident-Severity-Prediction

### This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub city police departments for Masters research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information have been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms algorithms.
###  Problem Statement: The target feature is Accident_severity which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 31 features step-by-step by going through each day's task.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated a dataset of 12316 records with 32 features, extracting insights on accident timing, driver characteristics, conditions, and casualty details.

*Hypothesis Testing: Analyzed gender's impact on accidents, speeding's significance, weekend trends, and daytime vs. nighttime accidents, concluding on gender equality, disproving speeding's significance, and examining weather conditions' influence.

*Preprocessing: Applied manual and frequency encoding, handled feature correlation , and addressed target variable imbalance with SMOTE.

*Model Selection: Explored various machine learning models including RandomForest, ExtraTrees, XGBoost, selecting ExtraTreesClassifier for superior performance.
